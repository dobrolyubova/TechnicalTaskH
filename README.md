# TechnicalTaskH
A polyline in 3D is given by the list of nodesâ€™ coordinates. Implement an algorithm that searches the nearest point on the polyline to any given point. In case of multiple solutions, output all of them.

# Brief manual
.exe file may be launched either without any parameters, or with parameters "t" or "g":  
`TechnicalTask1.exe t` will launch a series of tests. Since I have no experience with any testing frameworks, this is kind of a (lame) workaround. For tests, ensure the tests/ directory is present in the same working directory with .exe file;  
`TechnicalTask1.exe g` will generate the file with N points, where N is due to user;  
`TechnicalTask1.exe` will launch the required dialogue with user. When providing the file name, either provide its absolute path, or make sure the file is in the same directory as .exe.
