# TechnicalTaskH
A polyline in 3D is given by the list of nodesâ€™ coordinates. Implement an algorithm that searches the nearest point on the polyline to any given point. In case of multiple solutions, output all of them.

# Brief manual
.exe file may be launched as follows: 
`TechnicalTask1.exe "...path/filename.txt x y z` will launch the search for intersection of the point (x, y, z) with polyline provided by the points in file ...path/filename.txt. When providing the file name, either provide its absolute path, or make sure the file is in the same directory as .exe.
